/*Problem Statement

You will be given a directed graph as input. Then you will receive  queries. For each query, you will be given two nodes,  and . You need to determine whether you can go from  to  directly without using any other nodes.

Input Format

The first line will contain  and , the number of nodes and the number of edges, respectively. The values of the nodes range from  to .
Next  lines will contain two node values which means there is a connection from first node to second node.
The next line will contain .
The following  lines will each contain  and .
Constraints

Output Format

For each query output YES if it is possible to go from  to  directly without using any other nodes, NO otherwise. Don't forget to put a new line after each query.
